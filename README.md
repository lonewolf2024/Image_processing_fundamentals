# Image_processing_fundamentals

Image processing refers to process of transforming an Image to a form where useful information can be extracted from it. An image is a 2D arrangement of pixels. Each pixel has a integer value associated with it. 
The following black and white image of Mario is a 8 bit image. Though you can see the features of mario(like head, body, hands and legs) it is all numbers in a matrix.

When we say 8-bit image, it means that the intensity value at each pixel can take 2 power 8 (=256) values. This range starts from 0 and ends at 255. These values can be altered by simple operations and you can see how the image looks after it.

#Color v/s black and white images

In real world, we see a lot of colors. The electronic devices around us are capable of displaying very sharp and wide range of colors. So how does color image differ from a grayscale image.? 
An RGB image consists of three channels (Red,Green and Blue) superimposed one behind the other. While a grayscale image has only one channel.

An image of 200 x 100 in RGB format would be of size 200 x 100 x 3 (3 represents R G and B)
Same image in grayscale format would be 200 x 100.
